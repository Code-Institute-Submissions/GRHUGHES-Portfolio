# Gary Hughes Portfolio

This is my portfolio website to present to potential employers and collaborators. It has been built with responsive design making it accessible and simple to navigate on a range of devices from mobile to desktop. On the homepage there is some general info about myself. My portfolio inlcudes a page with my resume where you can find out about my education, work history and skill set. You can find examples of my work on GitHub via a projects page and for those interested in collaboration, I can be contacted with any ideas you might have. Lastly, you can easily download a copy of my CV from my website.

## UX (User Experience)

    • Does this fit a users needs?
    • Does the user like my website?
    • Does the user like being at my website?
    • Is this a website a user might want to return to in the future?

### User Stories

- As an employer, I want to see what Gary is capable of doing as software developer by seeing examples of his work, so that I have an idea if he is a good fit for my available position within our company.
- As a software development collaborator, I want an easy and appropriate way of contacting Gary with my collaboration idea, so that we can work together on something.
- As a software development student, I'm looking for design ideas and inspiration for my own project, so that I can do well in my course.
- As a recruitment agent, I want to see a broader overview of Gary by seeing his full resume and I expect to be able to easily download a copy of his CV for my records, so that I can determine whether Gary can be shortlisted for any of the available positions I need to fill.

### Design choices

#### Colour Scheme

- Three different shades of blue and mono colours.

#### Typography

- Michroma and Roboto are the main fonts used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font if for some reason the main fonts can't be imported into the site correctly. Both of these fonts are very popular in the developer world and are also very easy to read, so they are both attractive and appropriate. Michroma is used for my headings and menus, and Roboto is used for the remaining content.

#### Imagery

### Strategy

The focus of this project is I’m an unemployed software development student looking for work opportunities, collaboration ideas, contract work, and working with startups. First I need an online resume, an online presence for me and a place to showcase my work.
I have listed my opportunities to include in my website and rated each on a scale of 1 to 5 in terms of importance and viability or feasibility to determine what I will include in my first deployment and what will be left out atleast for the time being. For me , creating a minimal online presence is the primary goal followed by displaying a work portfolio. Increasing GitHub followers is the least important opportunity and is not really viable at the moment.

### Scope

It's important to provide employers and recruiting agents with a brief overview of myself and my capabilities. This way, they are able to get a look at who I am, my background, work I've done, and my skill set, and they have the option to contact me at their choosing.
